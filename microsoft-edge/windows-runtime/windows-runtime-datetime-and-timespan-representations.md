# Windows Runtime DateTime and TimeSpan Representations
The JavaScript representation of dates and times is different from the Windows Runtime version. The Windows Runtime [DateTime](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.foundation.datetime.aspx) structure is represented in JavaScript as a [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) that has a backing store that matches the `DateTime` data (and has a different range and precision from the JavaScript `Date`). If you modify this custom `Date` object, it becomes a standard JavaScript `Date` and loses precision. JavaScript `Date` values can be passed to a Windows Runtime `DateTime` and will be range-checked, which might result in marshaling exceptions.  
  
 The Windows Runtime [TimeSpan](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c5defb66-819c-4796-85b5-07ed249a5d86) structure is converted to milliseconds and returned as a JavaScript number.
