# Manage account settings

You can view and update your account settings and Profile details in the Account setting section of the [Partner center]

## Account settings

To view your account settings, click the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of Partner Center and then select **Developer settings**. Here you'll find details about your account and links to other pages where you can view information and perform various account-related tasks.

In the **Account details** section, you can see the status and type of your account. You can also see your Seller ID and other publisher ID info here. These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account and can't be edited.

## Contact Details

The **Contact info** section displays the details you provided when setting up your account. We use this detail to contact you about your account. The publisher display name that we show to your customers in the Store also appears here.

You can **edit** this section if any of your contact details has changed. To do so, click **Update** (or select Contact info in the left navigation menu), make your changes, and then click **Save**.

Changing any of your contact details may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account. Your verification status will return to Pending while this is in process. The verification process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company from our verification partner.

## Other settings

Below are some of the other items you'll find in the Account settings section.

- **Verification status**: When your account is undergoing the verification process (for example, when you first sign up or after you significantly update your contact info), you can review your verification status here.

- **Programs**: View details about the programs in which you are participating, and learn about other programs that may be of interest.

- **Agreements**: View the agreements that your account has accepted.
