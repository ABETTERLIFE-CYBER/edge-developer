# Update an extension Microsoft Store listing

## Update an already published extension

To update the Microsoft Store listing for your extension, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [developer dashboard]. From the **Overview** page, click the extension listing which you want to update. This brings up the submission form details which you filled out during publishing.

1. Make the changes you want to the package, description, graphic assets or other settings. If you update the package file, make sure that the version in the manifest is higher than the previous package version.

1. After making changes, click Save and Publish.

1. Visit the Partner center developer dashboard to see the status of your extension listing changed from **In the store** to **In the store. Certification in progress**. Note that the update publishing process can take from few hour to few days. Once the "Status" column says **In the store**, your extension update is available in the store.

## Update an extension which is at certification step
