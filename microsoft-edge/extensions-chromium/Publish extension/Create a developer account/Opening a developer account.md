# Opening a developer document

To submit browser extensions you’ve developed, you’ll need to set up a Microsoft Edge developer account in Partner Center.

## Registration process

1.	Go to the registration page (link to extensions webpage) and select Sign up.
2.	If you're not already signed in with a Microsoft account, sign in now, or create a new Microsoft account. The Microsoft account you use here will be what you use to sign in to your developer account. 
After sign in, you’ll land on this registration form:

> [!Note]
> If you are already registered as a Windows app developer with Microsoft, you’ll automatically be registered to Microsoft Edge developer account. 
  
3.	Select the country/region in which you live, or where your business is located. You won't be able to change this later.
4.	Select your developer account type (individual or company). You won't be able to change this later, so be sure to choose the right type of account.
5.	Enter the publisher display name that you wish to use (50 characters or fewer). Select this carefully, as customers will see this name when browsing your extensions. For company accounts, be sure to use your organization's registered business name. Note that if you enter a name that someone else has already selected, or if it appears that someone else has the rights to use that name, we will not allow you to use that name.
6.	Enter the contact details for your developer account. For company accounts, be sure to use your organization’s registered email address. Note that we'll use these details to contact you about account-related matters.
If you are registering as a company, you'll also need to enter the name, email address, and phone number of the person who will approve your company's account.

7.	Review your account details and confirm that everything is correct. Then, read and accept the terms and conditions of the Microsoft Edge Developer Agreement. 

8.	Click Finish to confirm your registration.
