# Update An Extension Listing

Update an existing listing in Microsoft Edge Addons catalog (Edge Addons). You may change a published Extension at any time. While you are updating, you do not have to update the entire Extension to make few changes such as updating description or logo. But if you update your Extension package, just remember to increase the version number each time.

## Update an already published Extension  

To update your listing, follow these steps:
1.	Go to your [developer dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099798). From the Overview page, click the listing which you want to update. This brings up the submission form details which you filled out during publishing.  
2.	Make the changes you want to the package, description, graphic assets or other settings. If you update the package file, make sure that the version in the manifest is higher than the previous package version.
3.	After making changes, click Save and then Publish.
4.	Visit the [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099798) developer dashboard to see the status of your listing changed from “In the store” to “In the store.  Certification in progress”. 

> [!NOTE]
> The duration of the update publishing process ranges from a few hours to few days. 
Once the **Status** column displays “In the store”, your Extension update is available in Edge Addons.

## Update an Extension during certification step

You may edit and update your Extension submission after submitting prior to it entering the Publish step. You may check the status of your Extension on the **Extension Overview** page associated with your listing on [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099798).
To edit your submission, you may follow these steps:

1.	Go to your [developer dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099798). From the **Overview** page, click the listing which you want to update. This brings up the submission form details which you filled out during publishing.  
2.	Go to **Extension overview** section using the left navigation bar as shown. **Cancel** the current submission by clicking **Cancel submission** button.
3.	Move to other section and make the changes you want to the package, description, graphic assets or other settings. If you update the package file, make sure that the version in the manifest is higher than the previous package version.
4.	After making changes, click **Save** and then **Publish**.
> [!NOTE]
> This process stops and removes your current submission from our certification pipeline and a new review starts with the latest submission. 
> [!NOTE]
> The duration of the update publishing process ranges from a few hours to few days.  

Once the **Status** column displays “In the store”, your Extension update is available in Edge Addons.
## Remove your Extension from Edge Addons

To remove your Extension from Edge Addons, do the following:
1.	Go to your [developer dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099798). From the **Overview** page, click the listing which you want to remove.  
2.	Open **Extension Overview** page of your listing
3.	Click **Unpublish**. This unpublishes the listing from Edge Addons.
