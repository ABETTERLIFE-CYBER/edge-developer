# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

To submit your extension to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website, you must be registered as a developer to the Microsoft Edge program on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter].

If you do not have an existing account with Partner Center, you need to create a new one using a [Microsoft (or MSA)][MSA] account. The support to sign up with a work or school account is yet to come.

> [!NOTE]
> How to create a Microsoft (or MSA) account?  To create a Microsoft account (Outlook/live/Hotmail), visit [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount] and select **Create a Microsoft account**.  

If you have an existing commercial account with Partner Center, you need to create a new MSA account to register to the Microsoft Edge program.  

If you are registered to Partner center with a developer account, use your corresponding MSA account to sign-in for the first time to enroll to Microsoft Edge program. To manage extensions in the future, we plan to support linking of AAD tenant to MSA accounts. Keep an eye out for the upcoming support for this! 

There is no registration fee involved to submit extensions to the Microsoft Edge program. 

Once logged into the account, fill out the following fields of the registration form. 
    
1.  Account country/region

The country/region is where you either live or your business is located. You cannot change the value of this field later. 

2. Account type 

The Microsoft Edge program in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] offers both individual and company accounts. Both account types allow you to publish extensions to the Microsoft Edge add-ons catalog. 

Company accounts are intended for organizations and businesses.  If you are registering as a company, your account will go through an account verification process which takes almost a week to complete. Choose this account type only if your extensions represent your company. 

Individual accounts are usually appropriate for developers not representing any company and working on their own. 

You cannot change the account type later once the selection is made; ensure you are choosing the right account type. 

| Individual account | Company account |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Individual account is appropriate for developers representing themselves only. | Company account is intended for organizations and businesses. |  
| Shorter account verification process | Greater account verification to confirm you have authorization to set up an account for your company |  

3. Publisher display name 

The name used across all your extensions submitted to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website. This name will be visible to the users browsing through the extensions catalog.  

The name must be 50 characters or fewer. You may use a name only if it is available and you have the rights to use it. For company accounts, make sure to use the registered business name of your organization. 

4. Contact details

Microsoft uses these details to contact you regarding account-related matters. Youâ€™ll receive an email confirmation once you complete the registration process. For company accounts, ensure you are using the registered email address of your organization.  

5. Company approver 

If you are registering as a company, fill out the contact details (name, email address and phone number) of your company approver. These details will be used to contact the approver as a part of the vetting process to ensure your extensions represent your organization. This could either be a superior in the company or your own details if you are one of the founders of the company. 

Review your account details to confirm everything is correct, read and accept the terms and conditions of the [Microsoft Edge Developer Agreement][MicrosoftAppDeveloperAgreement]. Click on Finish to confirm your registration. Once done, you will be redirected to the developer dashboard where you can start your extension publishing process. 

## Account Verification  

After you complete the registration process, your account is verified. For individual accounts, we check the availability of your publisher display name. For company accounts, the process takes a little longer to confirm you have authorization to set up the account for your company. The duration of the verification process ranges from a few days to a couple of weeks, and your company may receive a phone call from our verification partner. Your company account must be verified before you can submit your extension. While you wait for the verification process to complete; you may continue to build, test, and prepare your submissions. 

You can check your verification status on the **Account settings** page.


## Next steps

Once you have completed the registration process, you can start working on building your own extension. Refer to the **Getting started** guide for a stepwise tutorial on creating an extension. Once you have a working extension ready to be published to the Edge add-ons website, refer to the **Extension publishing** process documentation.
