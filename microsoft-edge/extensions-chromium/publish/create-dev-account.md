# Register as a Microsoft Edge extension developer  

To submit your extension to the Microsoft Edge add-ons website, you must be registered as a developer with the Microsoft Edge program on [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter]. There is no registration fee involved in submitting extensions to the Microsoft Edge program.

## Before you begin

If you do not have an existing account with Partner Center or if you have an existing commercial account with Partner Center, you need to create a new [Microsoft account (MSA)][MSA] to register with the Microsoft Edge program. 
To create a Microsoft account (Outlook/live/Hotmail), visit [account.microsoft.com][MicrosoftAccount] and select **Create a Microsoft account**. If you are registered on the Partner center with a developer account, use the corresponding Microsoft account(MSA) to sign-in, and then enroll in the Microsoft Edge program.

> [!NOTE]
> Today we do not support signing up with a work or school account. In the future, we plan to support linking AAD tenants to MSA accounts for extension management.


## Enroll in the Microsoft Edge program on Partner Center

To enroll in the Microsoft Edge program, sign in to your account, and fill out the form. 
    
**1. Account country/region**

The country/region is where you either live or your business is located. After enrollment, the value of this field cannot be changed.

**2. Account type** 

The Microsoft Edge program in [Partner Center][MicrosoftPartnerCenter] offers both individual and company accounts, which are described in detail in the table that follows. Both account types allow you to publish extensions to the Microsoft Edge add-ons catalog. After registration, the value of this field cannot be changed.


| Individual account | Company account |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Individual accounts are appropriate for developers not associated with a company. | Company accounts are associated with organizations and businesses. |  
| The account verification process is shorter, and involves verifying that the publisher display name is available. | The account verification process is longer, and involves confirmation that you are authorized to set up the account for your company. The duration of this process may range from a few days to a few weeks. Your company may receive phone calls from our verification partners.  |  

**3. Publisher display name**(max. length 50 characters)

This is the display name that is shown to users in the Microsoft Edge add-ons catalog. You may use a name only if it’s available, and you have the rights to use it. Company accounts must use your organization’s registered business name.

**4. Contact details**

Any contact information that Microsoft may use to contact you regarding any account issues. After registration is complete, you’ll receive an email confirmation. Company accounts must use the registered email address of their organization.

**5. Company approver** 

For company accounts, provide the contact information (name, email address and phone number) of your company approver. Microsoft will contact the company approver specified as a part of the verification process to ensure that the extensions belong to your organization. 

Before submitting your registration form, read and accept the terms and conditions of the [Microsoft Edge Developer Agreement][MicrosoftAppDeveloperAgreement]. Choose Finish to complete your enrollment. 



## Next steps

You may view your verification status on the **Account settings** page in Partner Center. While you wait for the verification process to complete; you may continue to build, test, and prepare your submissions.

For more information, see **Extension publishing** process documentation. For information on getting started with extensions, see the **Getting started** guide.
