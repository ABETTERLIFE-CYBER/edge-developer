#  Microsoft Edge (Chromium) extensions

Extensions are small programs that can be used to add new features to Microsoft Edge (Chromium) or modify the existing functionality. Extensions are intended to improve a userâ€™s day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that is important to targeted audiences.

Microsoft Edge (Chromium) supports a new HTML, JavaScript and CSS based extension model. This new model is Chrome-compatible which means that existing Chrome extension developers will be able to migrate their extensions to Microsoft Edge (Chromium) with minimal or no changes.

To get an overview of the end to end journey of creating a Microsoft Edge (Chromium) extension from development to publishing, check out the [Getting started guide](./extensions-chromium/getting-started.md)!
